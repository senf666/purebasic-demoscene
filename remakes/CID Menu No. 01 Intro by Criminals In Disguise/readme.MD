#CID Menu No. 01 Intro by Criminals In Disguise

First ever remake of a Criminals In Disguise menu after I stumbled across them recently.
A simple 2D stafield, faded bouncing raster bars, a 64x32 sine scroller and a big VU meter and of course excellent music by Mad Max from Rings of Medusa.
All ripped and coded in about 8 hours in total.
