Another demo remake. This time, one from ST Connexion from the Dream Demo called the Spotlight Demo.  
This was one of the early fullscreen/overscan demos for 1989 and very nice it is too on a real ST.

Contains:
- 3 plane starfield
- VU bars
- Pourdown/up logo (finally managed to convert that part!)
- Bendy/distorted rastered scrolltext with reflection in the bottom border
- Moving spotlight that shines on the big central logo

Learned a few new tricks in PureBasic converting this one that I will share once I comment the code.  
It's all written in PureBasic using only the native commands. No OpenGL or SDL. Nothing like that. Just the standard PureBasic 2D sprite commands.
