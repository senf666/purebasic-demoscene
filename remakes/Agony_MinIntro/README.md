# Agony Mini Intro

[Forum thread](https://www.dbfinteractive.com/forum/index.php?topic=6751.0)

This is a small intro to pay tribute to **PSYGNOSIS** and the superb **AGONY** on AMIGA.  
The most difficult part was to recover and adapt the sprites.

The archive contains:
- Some of the images (sprites and mod are in the datasection)
- The code
- The images

**Controls:**  
Use the arrow keys to move the Owl.
