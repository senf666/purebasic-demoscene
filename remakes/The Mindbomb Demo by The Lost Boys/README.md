This PureBasic code is for the Ah Yeah! screen by Digital Insanity for The Lost Boys MindBomb Demo on the Atari ST.  
Credit to STos for ripping the fonts for me. Cheers mate.

All the rest of the hacking, ripping, and dumping have been done by me, including converting the raster palettes and sine waves.
Uses standard PureBasic sprite and image routines, either native or in my own libraries that have been included in this package.

The Oldskool Music Engine, originally coded by Slippy and now made into a PB user library by me a while ago, is also included here.  
It is x86 compiler only, as that's how it was originally coded by Slippy.  
The C source for his engine is online if any C coders want to try and re-code it for x64. Good luck with it.

Feel free to use and abuse my code, make it better, faster, add stuff to it, etc.  
But don't forget where it came from, as a credit is always nice if you use it in your own prods. :-)

### Notes

- Use compiler option for `directx9` or `dx9` depending on what version you're using.
- Tested on PureBasic 5.73 LTS and `dx9` subsystem.
- After PB 6.x, the image transparency no longer works properly.
