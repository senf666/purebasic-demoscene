# Fuzion 141 Win32 Remake

**Author:** KrazyK  
**Date:** 22:12:2013  
**Language:** PureBasic 5.21 LTS  
**Requires:** PureProcs library for Zippy's oldskool music engine (both included)  
**Compatibility:** Doesn't use any v5.xx specific functions, so it should also work with 4.xx (can't test this anymore, so don't blame me).  
**Note:** Set JaPbe real tabs to 8 to display correctly.

This was all done in about 8 hours from start to finish, including searching for, ripping, and converting a Count Zero tune that didn't exist in the sndh archive (at least not that I could find). I tried all Count Zero files with all tune numbers.

I'm making this available to DBF so that anyone new to PureBasic or wanting to learn how to do remakes, etc., could (maybe) learn a bit from it. I've done more complicated remakes, so this is a good starter. It shows the principles involved in setting the screen up and creating a simple scroller.

It also has a nice, simple VU meter line routine that I've only just created!

I finished this Atari ST remake before Christmas and thought I would share the source and data files here. After all, Christmas is all about giving!  
It was a pretty quick one to do but interesting ripping the music out of the original due to the fact that some of the Count Zero music in this one wasn't in the sndh archive.

There are 12 tunes in this one, selectable using keys:  
- 'grave' (the odd one left of the number 1 and below esc)  
- up to the 'minus' key

All the required files are in the zip, including the `.ST` file for STeem.

It requires the PureProcs library copied into your `\PureLibraries\UserLibraries` folder wherever you have installed PureBasic, which I've included in the zip.

It's written using v5.21 LTS but I've tried not to use any 5.xx specific commands so it should run on earlier versions too. Unfortunately, I can't try this out anymore so don't blame me if it bombs.  ::)
