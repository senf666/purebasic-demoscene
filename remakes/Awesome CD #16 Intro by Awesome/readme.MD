# Awesome CD #16 Intro by Awesome

I've managed to comment this piece of code for my remake of Awesome menu 16 and thought I would share it with you guys here.  
Quite a simple effect but looks really nice.

It uses some of my custom userlibraries for PureBasic, so make sure you are using at least 5.2x of PB before running it.  
Feel free to butcher it, hack, spread it, or use it in your own progs if you find it in any way useful.

## Custom (Windows only) userlibraries

- **KK_Window:** Used because I'm lazy at typing `openwindow...` blah, blah, blah
- **KK_Rasters:** Used for creating a simple horizontal raster bar of any colour. Returns it as a sprite.
- **KK_OMSELibrary:** Used for the OldSkool Music Engine. I finally managed to make a working library out of it. Saves me loads of time.

Just copy the `PureLibraries` folder into the correct place before running PB.
