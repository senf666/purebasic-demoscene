Zuul 165 cracktro PureBasic remake code.  
This should work on all versions from 5.x upwards.  
Just copy the OSME library into your userlibraries folder.  
**Note:** x86 and Windows only.

For PureBasic 5.xx, change the subsystem to `dx9` instead of `directx9` as the subsystem folder names were changed after 6.xx.
