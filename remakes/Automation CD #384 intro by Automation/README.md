# Automation CD 384 Menu Remake

I updated my old code from 2011 for this menu remake to get it working on **PureBasic 5.73 (x86)**.  
Added the disk drive loading and depacker from my oldskool library (included here).

It's all commented as far as I can make sense of it, so feel free to use and abuse it.
