# Le Labyrinthe De Lexicos by Atari Legend and NoExtra

Here's a bit more PureBasic code (v5.42) for my Lexicos intro.  
It's as close as I could get to the original and is commented so you should be able to follow it and play about with it.

It uses my custom Vectorlines library (x86 built) so please try it out as I'd like to know if it works on other systems.  
Please feel free to butcher/edit it as much as you want and play about with the 3D files. Even create your own and upload your efforts here again.

Copy the `UserLibraries` folder to your PB `PureLibraries` folder and restart PB.
