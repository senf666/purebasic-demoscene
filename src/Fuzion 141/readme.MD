# Fuzion 141 Win32 Remake
**Author:** KrazyK  
**Date:** 22:12:2013  
**Language:** Purebasic 5.21 LTS  
**Requires:** PureProcs library for Zippy's oldskool music engine (both included)  
**Compatibility:** Doesn't use any v5.xx specific functions, so it should also work with 4.xx (can't test this anymore, so don't blame me).  
**Note:** Set JaPbe real tabs to 8 to display correctly.

This was all done in about 8 hours from start to finish, including searching for, ripping, and converting a Count Zero tune that didn't exist in the sndh archive (at least not that I could find). I tried all Count Zero files with all tune numbers.  

I'm making this available to DBF so that anyone new to PureBasic or wanting to learn how to do remakes, etc., could (maybe) learn a bit from it. I've done more complicated remakes, so this is a good starter. It shows the principles involved in setting the screen up and creating a simple scroller.  

It also has a nice, simple VU meter line routine that I've only just created!
