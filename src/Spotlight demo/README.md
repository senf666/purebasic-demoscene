Another demo remake.  This time one from ST Connexion from the Dream Demo called the Spotlight Demo.This was one of the early fullscreen/overscan demos for 1989 and very nice it is too on a real ST.Contains a 3 plane starfield, vu bars, a pourdown/up logo (finally managed to convert that part !), a bendy/disted rastered scrolltext with reflection in the bottom border, and a moving spotlight that shines on the big central  logo.Learned a few new trick in PureBasic converting this one that I will share once I comment the code.It's all written in purebasic using only the native commands. No opengl or sdl. Nothing like that. Just the standard Purebasic 2d sprite commands.
