From The MindBomb Demo

Code:        Digital Insanity
Gfx:        Digital Insanity
Music:        Mad Max
Released:    April 1990

Tested and working with 5.73 LTS. PB 6.x upwards has issues with image transparency so use a lower version.

;This Purebaisc code is for the Ah Yeah! screen by Digital Insanity for The Lost Boys MindBomb Demo on the Atari ST
;Credit to STos for ripping the fonts for me.  Cheers mate.

;All the rest of the hacking and ripping and dumping have been done by me including converting the raster palettes and sine waves.
;Uses standard Purebasic sprite and image routines either native or in my own libraries that have been included in this package.

;The Oldskool Music Engine originally coded by Slippy and now made into a PB userlibrary by me a while ago is also included here too. 
;It is x86 only compiler only though as that's how it was originally coded by Slippy.
;The c source for his engine is online if anyone c coders want to try and re-code it for x64.  Good luck with it.
;Feel free to use and abuse my code, make it better, faster, add shit to it etc, etc. etc. 
;But don't forget where it came from as a credit is always nice if you use it in your own prods. :-)

;Notes;
;Use compiler option for directx9 or dx9 depending on what version you're using.
;Tested on Purebasic 5.73 LTS and dx9 subsystem.
;After PB 6.x the image transparency no longer works properly.
