# Orion Remake - PureBasic Source

Here's the commented PureBasic source for the Orion remake.  
Everything is included in the zip to run it, including the OSME library.

Another Stax remake, and this one is an eye burner. It was a bit trickier than I originally thought it was going to be to remake. All done now with the sine data ripped from the original too.
